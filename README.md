## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- Vite for development and build process
- GitHub Pages for deployment

### What I learned

To dynamically add the data using the provided json data, I make use of code below to dynamically generate the score list items. Also, I use the reduce() method to get the total score and find the average by dividing my number of scores using he length method. I also use object destructuring to extract only the score value from each object.

```ts

// Create a variable to accumulate all list items
let listItemsHTML = '';

data.forEach(({ category, score, icon }) => {
  // Construct the HTML structure using template literals
  listItemsHTML += `
    <li class="card__summary-result ${category.toLowerCase()}">
      <div class="card__summary-result-title">
        <img class="card__summary-result-icon" src="${icon}" aria-hidden="true" alt="icon">
        <h3 class="card__summary-result-name">${category}</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="card__summary-result-value"><span>${score}</span> / 100</p>
    </li>
  `;
});

// Append all list items to the container at once
resultsContainer.innerHTML = listItemsHTML;

const totalScore = data.reduce((sum, { score }) => sum + score, 0);
const averageScore = Math.round(totalScore / data.length);

resultScore.innerText = `${averageScore}`;

```

### Continued development

I plan to explore advanced SASS features to enhance the maintainability and scalability of my stylesheets. I also intend to further integrate TypeScript in future frontend projects to reinforce type safety and streamline debugging.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide was instrumental in implementing the flexible layout of the component.
- [MDN Web Docs: CSS Display Property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) - Helped me with controlling element visibility.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - Engaging with other developers in the community provided insights and useful tips for handling responsive layouts.
